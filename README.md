# GraphingBot
Code written in C++ and RobotC for a first year design project, which allowed a robot to plot functions on a whiteboard.
This project was created collaboratively with Kevin Gu and Aidan Gratton.

Note that some software libraries for the robotC code have not been included, as I do not own the rights to distribute them.
