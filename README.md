# GraphingBot
Code written in C++ and RobotC for a first year design project, which allowed a robot to plot functions on a whiteboard.
This project was created collaboratively with Kevin Gu and Aidan Gratton.

# Features
- Inputting any number of arbitrary polynomial terms in any order that the user desires
- Parsing and generating path planning file for the robot to plot it on the white board
- Limit switches allowing consistent coordinate tracking
- Movable pulley system to lift the end effector
- Ultrasonic sensor to keep track of the robot's distance from the wall as a safety feature
- Implemented erasing as well as plotting
